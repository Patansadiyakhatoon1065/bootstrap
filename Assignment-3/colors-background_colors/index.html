    <p class="text-info bg-dark">Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of
        the human activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several
        delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all
        the gifts from nature. Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in the
        nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul. Irrespective of what nature provides us it is also our
        moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.</p>
